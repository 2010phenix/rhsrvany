When you need to run some program or batch script as a Windows
service, you either have to modify the program so it calls the Windows
service APIs (impossible for a batch script), or you use "SrvAny" to
turn the program/script into a service.

Unfortunately SrvAny is a proprietary program.  This is a free
software equivalent.

This program was originally written by Yuval Kashtan as part of the
Qumranet / RHEV-M / oVirt project, and released as free software by
Red Hat.
